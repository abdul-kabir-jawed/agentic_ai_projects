# Specification Quality Checklist: Evolution of Todo – 5-Phase AI-Native Todo System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-07  
**Feature**: [specs/001-evolution-of-todo/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Validation completed**: 2025-12-07
- **All items pass**: Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- Technology constraints are mentioned at requirements level only (e.g., "console application", "web interface", "container orchestration") without prescribing specific implementations
- The 5-phase structure provides clear milestones with measurable success criteria for each
- Reusable asset requirements ensure knowledge capture for future projects
