the neon strucutre having public table name chat_messages, tasks, user tell me what table are of no use remeber they are public we have neon_auth having account, session, user, verification
the change i want was the chat messages and task gets in one table where we have user email name and id we get that from session and in the same folder we have task column that have a dictionary inside having value for id, description, priority, tags, due_date, created_at, updated_at, is_daily and another column for ai chats that only store till 10 chats whenever new gets add the one that becomes the 11 gets deleted and the ai chaat column will also have a dictionary having value of role, content, created_at inside so this is the table i want so each user will have there own task and ai chats in the same row so we have more structured table.
